<h1> TPRinfo </h1>
<h4>tprinfo is a web based application that automates the tasks performed by TAP(Training and Placement Cell) member at NIT Jamshedpur. Placement season is a busy time for students as well as for Placement cell co-ordinators. A lot of times it is observed that accumulating academic and personal details of all the students of the class is a cumbersome task. Moreover there are many dynamic components of details that keep changing frequently. e.g. - CGPA which changes after every semester. Even phone number in some cases.
